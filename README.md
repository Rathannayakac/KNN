# KNN
Completed my first data science assignment on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm as part of my data science course.The assignment includes an implementation of KNN and its application on a dataset to classify instances based on their nearest neighbors. Excited to share my progress on GitHub and continue exploring more data science concepts
